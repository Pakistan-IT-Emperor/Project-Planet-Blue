      <p class="aa">In 1900, the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the
         atmosphere was 291 parts per million (ppm). This was an increase from 288 ppm in 1860.<br><br>
         The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased since the start of the Industrial
          Revolution in 1750. This increase is due to the burning of fossil fuels for energy and the 
          growth of the population. In 1900, the world released 
         almost 2 billion metric tons of CO2 from fossil fuels. By 1960, that number
          had more than quadrupled.
        <br><br>
        Monthly mean atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO₂) concentrations reached a record high of 426.91 parts 
        per million (ppm) in June 2024. This represents an increase of roughly 20 percent compared with average
         CO₂ levels
         recorded in June 1990. In 2023, global 
         average annual CO₂ concentrations reached a record high of 421 ppm.<br><br><br><br>

      Here's a content draft for a webpage on Global Warming. It covers the basics of what global warming is, its causes, effects, and solutions, structured in a way suitable for a webpage.
      
      Global Warming: Understanding the Crisis
      What is Global Warming?
      Global warming refers to the gradual increase in the Earth’s average surface temperature
       due to human activities that increase levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Since the 
       Industrial Revolution, human actions—such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and intensive 
       agriculture—have led to significant changes in the environment. 
      These changes trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, leading to rising temperatures worldwide.
      <br><br><br>
      <span class="ad">Causes of Global Warming</span><br><br>
      1.   <span class="da">Burning Fossil Fuels:</span> Coal, oil, and natural 
      gas are burned to produce energy, releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) and other greenhouse gases.<br>
      2.   <span class="da">Deforestation:</span> Trees absorb CO₂,
       so cutting them down means more CO₂ remains in the atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect.<br>
      3.   <span class="da">Agriculture and Livestock:</span> Intensive
       farming and livestock practices release large amounts of methane, a potent greenhouse gas.<br>
      4.   <span class="da">Industrial Processes:</span> Many manufacturing processes emit 
      various greenhouse gases that contribute to warming the planet. 
      <br><br><br>
      <span class="ae">Effects of Global Warming</span>
      <br><br>
      Global warming has far-reaching effects that impact every aspect of life on Earth.<br>
       Some key effects include:<br><br>
       <ul>
    <li><span class="da">Melting Ice and Rising Sea Levels:</span> The warming climate melts polar ice caps and glaciers, 
          causing sea levels to rise, which threatens coastal communities and habitats.</li><br>
    <li><span class="da">Extreme Weather Events:</span> Global warming contributes to more frequent and severe 
      weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, wildfires, and heavy rains.</li><br>
    <li><span class="da">Ecosystem Disruption:</span> Rising temperatures and changing weather patterns disrupt 
        ecosystems, pushing many species toward extinction and affecting biodiversity.</li><br>
    <li><span class="da">Health Risks:</span> Warmer temperatures can worsen air quality, leading to respiratory issues. 
      There is also an increased risk of heat-related illnesses and the spread of infectious diseases.</li><br>
       </ul>
       
       <p class="de">What Can We Do to Stop Global Warming?</p><br>
       <p class="ed">Though global warming is a serious issue, there are steps we can take to reduce its effects:
        <br><br>
        1.   <span class="da">Shift to Renewable Energy:</span> Replacing fossil fuels with renewable energy sources 
        like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power can reduce greenhouse gas emissions.<br><br>
        2.   <span class="da">Energy Efficiency: </span>Using energy-efficient appliances and reducing energy consumption helps lower emissions.<br><br>
        3.   <span class="da">Protect and Restore Forests: </span>Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing CO₂ from
         the atmosphere. Protecting existing forests and planting new trees are crucial.<br><br>
        4.   <span class="da">Sustainable Agriculture:</span> Reducing emissions from agricultural practices, supporting 
        sustainable farming, and shifting towards plant-based diets can make a difference.<br><br>
        5.   <span class="da">Support Policy Changes:</span> Advocating for environmental policies and supporting international 
        agreements like the Paris Agreement can help address global warming on a larger scale.
       </p>
       <br><br>
       <p class="ef">Join the Fight Against Global Warming</p><br>
       <p class="fe">
        Every action counts. By making small changes in our daily lives and supporting 
        policies and initiatives aimed at reducing emissions, we can
         help combat global warming. Together, we can work towards a more sustainable
          and resilient future for all.
